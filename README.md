# HII-CHI-Mistry

HII-CHI-Mistry is a collection of python subroutines aimed at the calculation of chemical abundances and physical properties using emission line fluxes from ionised gaseous nebulae. 

## Requirements

HII-CHI-Mistry was written for [Python v.2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/), but since its latest versions it is also compatible with [Python v.3.](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/). It requires the Python library [NumPy](https://numpy.org).

## Versions

HII-CHI-Mistry presents different variations depending on the spectral range analysed and the analysis to be performed with the input data. These are the available options:

- HII-CHI-Mistry for optical emission lines ([HCm](https://github.com/Borja-Perez-Diaz/HII-CHI-Mistry/tree/main/HCm-opt))
- HII-CHI-Mistry for ultraviolet emission lines ([HCm-uv](https://github.com/Borja-Perez-Diaz/HII-CHI-Mistry/tree/main/HCm-uv))
- HII-CHI-Mistry for infrared emission lines ([HCm-ir](https://github.com/Borja-Perez-Diaz/HII-CHI-Mistry/tree/main/HCm-ir))
- HII-CHI-Mistry for equivalent effective temperature ([HCm-teff](https://github.com/Borja-Perez-Diaz/HII-CHI-Mistry/tree/main/HCm-teff))
